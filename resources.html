    <h2>Text Editors</h2>
    <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all stored in text files that browsers know how to interpret. You can write them in any
        text editor, such as Notepad, but more specialized tools exist, such as Sumblime Text, Atom, and the CodeSLO recommended
        Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a></h3>
    <h3><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a></h3>
    <h3><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></h3>
    <h2>Browsers</h2>
    <p>Most modern browsers include a suite of developer's tools. The gold standard is Google's Chrome browser. All major operating
        systems include web browsers, but here are others available as free downloads. A good developer knows to test in
        multiple browsers.</p>

    <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
    <p>Anyone looking to learn web development in 2017 has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to learning resources, especially
        on the Central Coast. Everything one would need to know to be a professional developer, including learning material,
        coding challenges, projects, hosting space and an active community of fellow learners is available at no cost. Below
        are some of the best of these resources.</p>
    <h3><a href="http://www.codeslo.com" target="_blank">CodeSLO</a></h3>
    <p>CodeSLO is the Central Coast's community for learning to code, free. With regular in-person meetups and mentoring by
        local professionals, CodeSLO is the place to spend your Wednesday evenings in the SLO area. Beginning and Advanced
        meetups available.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></h3>
    <p>Codecademy offers a wealth of introductory courses in multiple programming languages. Paid courses are available, but
        the free offerings are excellent as well. The only shortcoming of Codecademy is a lack of practice projects. Remember,
        the only way to learn is by building!</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a></h3>
    <p>Free Code Camp is possibly the best one-stop site for learning development on the Internet. Starting with basic HTML,
        continuing through a deep JavaScript curriculum, and ending with real-world projects for non-profit organizations,
        Free Code Camp also features a very large and vibrant community of learners and mentors. If you decide to join, tell
        them CodeSLO sent you!</p>
    <h2>Free Books</h2>

            target="_blank">fantastic list</a> of free books on web development that will take you deep into a variety of technologies.</p>

    <h2>Coding Schools and Camps</h2>
    <p>For those looking to fast-track a career in web development, there are several coding schools that can take you from
        intermediate to professional in just a few (very intense) months. Note, these schools don't accept just anyone, applicants
        need a strong foundation in web development before applying. Also note, these camps are not cheap! Unless you compare
        them to college, in which case they seem like a bargain.</p>
    <p>It isn't necessary to attend one of these camps to make the leap to professional developer, but they can greatly lessen
        the time it takes to do so.
